# Storium
Storium is a gently interactive, emotion-driven storytelling app.
Each story places you in a moment — grief, depression, loneliness — and lets you move through it one choice at a time.
Nothing dramatic. No fantasy quests. Just quiet, real human feelings presented in a way that’s simple, soft, and deeply relatable.

You choose how you respond.
The story shifts with you — sometimes calmly, sometimes anxiously — and the ending reflects the tone you carried through it.

Every scene is paired with atmospheric art, subtle mood tracking, and a warm, supportive summary at the end.
It’s not a diagnostic tool. It’s just a small space to breathe, reflect, and maybe understand yourself a little better.

If you like emotionally immersive experiences, gentle aesthetics, and storytelling with heart, Storium is built exactly for that.
